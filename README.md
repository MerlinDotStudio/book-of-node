## Summary

This is our boilerplate, setup in a way that fits our needs and hopefully that of others.

When we started developing, we ran into a lot of moments where we wished we could have a tooling setup that would make life easier.

This boilerplate does the following things;

* uses an ```.env``` file
* PostCSS support
* Implement Critical CSS
* .ejs support
* Hot reloading support for .ejs and .css files. (This was a big painpoint for us)
* Implements babel to compile new Javascript features (such as Async Await) to support IE 10+ browsers
* Bundles and generates sourcemaps for .js files while developing
* Implements ESLint for .js linting, stylelint for .css linting and EJSLint for useful .ejs error messages.
* Attempts to fix small linting issues on its own, such as indentation, based on your settings.
* Copies files such as fonts and images from the ```src``` folder to the ```public``` folder.
* Minifies all the .js and .css files on building
* Groups media query selectors on build
* Adds a command to easily add a component

## How to start

After cloning the repository, head to the folder and run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### .ENV

First of all, you need an .env file. We included a command that will generate an empty .env file for you in the ```config/``` folder.

The command is

```sh
yarn run build:env
```

You need to configure the .env file, otherwise the server won't have a port to run your project on. You can copy this code example and paste it in the .env file found at ```config/.env```.

```sh
NODE_ENV=development

PORT=8004
DEV_PORT=8000
```

Where NODE_ENV is the environment you are in (development or production)

PORT the port your application will run on
DEV_PORT the port you will develop on.

Please note that the DEV_PORT is the number that you will have to add after the ```localhost:``` url.

### Development

To start developing, run the command:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

This will start a development server at ```localhost:8000```

### Add new component

We have a command that will generate a folder with the files needed for a component:

```sh
yarn component name
```

Where **name** is the name you want to give the component. Use dashes(-) in stead of spaces.

### Build

To build your project, run the command:

```sh
yarn run build
```

### Sqip + lazyload

In this setup we use sqip to generate low res svg's that can be used as placeholders. In the same time lazyloading will (lazy) load the correct file and swap them out.

To generate the placeholders you can run the build command or directly run:

```sh
yarn run build:sqip
```

To set up the `HTML` correctly use the following:

```html
<img class="lazy" data-src="/images/FHD.jpg" src="/images/FHD.svg" alt="">
```
