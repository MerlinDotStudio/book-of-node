## Summary

This is our boilerplate, setup in a way that fits our needs and hopefully that of others.

When we started developing, we ran into a lot of moments where we wished we could have a tooling setup that would make life easier.

This boilerplate does the following things;

* uses an ```.env``` file
* PostCSS support
* Implement Critical CSS
* .ejs support
* Hot reloading support for .ejs and .css files. (This was a big painpoint for us)
* Implements babel to compile new Javascript features (such as Async Await) to support IE 10+ browsers
* Bundles and generates sourcemaps for .js files while developing
* Implements ESLint for .js linting, stylelint for .css linting and EJSLint for useful .ejs error messages.
* Attempts to fix small linting issues on its own, such as indentation, based on your settings.
* Copies files such as fonts and images from the ```src``` folder to the ```public``` folder.
* Minifies all the .js and .css files on building
* Groups media query selectors on build
